Select to install from the CDROM.


Select "Yes" or "No" for crypto choice.

Select "All" for distributions.

Select Yes or No for crypto.

Select Yes or No for ports collection.
Ports takes a while to install :-/


Install from the CDROM 

For XF86 Setup, configure the mouse for SysMouse on /dev/psm0.
Click Apply and Done.

Packages for Enlightenment are on the CDROM.


Set up networking.
3.2 did not have a DHCP option.  Set up ed0 interface manually.

Set up user, add to wheel group.



Try configuring X Windows with XF86Setup graphical mode.

Note on X Windows - use ctl-alt-backspace to exit the server
if needed.


Finish install, reboot, and test.

System should show the Boot Manager on reboot.
The stored kernel configuration will be applied to the reboot.

May have to add a default rouute.

NOTE!!  There is ssh or scp installed.  It's also likely that
any communication with modern SSL encrypted systems will fail
because of lack of similar cipher capabilities (these are too old.)
